# Exact TSP Solver (TSP ORACLE) [Go] <sup>v0.1.5</sup>

---

A high-performance, exact solver for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) implemented in Go. 
Utilizes an intelligent Branch and Bound algorithm with adaptive thresholding to 
find the globally optimal solution for small to medium-sized TSP instances.

## üß† What is "Branch and Bound" with Adaptive Thresholding?

This isn't a naive brute-force search. It's a sophisticated method that:
1.  **Sets a smart initial threshold** based on a quick heuristic solution (Greedy + 2-opt).
2.  **Uses a lower bound** (based on Minimum Spanning Tree) to prune futile branches of the search tree.
3.  **Dynamically adjusts the threshold** every iteration: lowers it if a better solution is found, or raises it if the search space is too constrained.
4.  **Employs neighborhood ordering** by checking nearest neighbors first to maximize pruning effectiveness.

This combination makes it significantly faster than a pure brute-force approach for finding provably optimal solutions.

## ‚ö° Features

*   **‚úÖ Provably Optimal:** Finds the absolute shortest possible route, not an approximation.
*   **üß© Adaptive Algorithm:** Smart Branch and Bound with dynamic threshold adjustment for efficient search.
*   **üìä Built-in Benchmarking:** Compare optimal vs. heuristic solutions and see the performance gap.
*   **üõ°Ô∏è Production-Grade Go:** Compiled to a single binary, static typing, no external dependencies.
*   **üìà Progress Tracking:** Real-time console output showing search speed and number of paths evaluated.

## üöÄ Usage

```bash
git clone https://github.com/smartlegionlab/exact-tsp-solver.git
cd exact-tsp-solver
```

The solver generates random points by default for demonstration. You can run it simply by:

v2 (stable):

```bash
go run tsp_oracle/v2/tsp_oracle_v2.go -n 10 -seed 123
```

**ATTENTION!** `tsp_oracle/v1/tsp_oracle_v1.go` This is v1 version, not recommended for use, serves only as an example for comparison with `tsp_oracle_v2.go`

v1 (old):

```bash
go run tsp_oracle/v1/tsp_oracle_v1.go -n 10 -seed 123
```

### Command Line Flags
| Flag | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `-n` | `10` | Number of points to generate. |
| `-seed` | `42` | Random seed for reproducible point generation. |


## üß™ Use Cases

*   **Academic Research:** Validate the performance of heuristic algorithms against the true optimum on small graphs.
*   **Education:** Perfect for teaching and understanding the Branch and Bound technique and the complexity of NP-Hard problems.
*   **Algorithmic Competitions:** As a reference solver for small test cases.
*   **Basis for Hybrid Solvers:** The optimal solver can be used in large-scale solvers that break the problem into smaller, solvable sub-problems.
